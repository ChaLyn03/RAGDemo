You must correct the draft output.

Rules (must follow):
- Use ONLY facts stated in the User request, IR, or the Relevant corpus excerpts.
- Do NOT invent values. If not stated anywhere, write: "Not specified in provided input."
- Output MUST be exactly 3 sections with these headings (verbatim):
  1) ## Overview
  2) ## Materials & tolerances
  3) ## Vibration reliability practices
- Keep it concise. No extra headers, no title.

Correction task:
- The previous output failed validation.
- You MUST incorporate exemplar-backed details when they exist in the excerpts.

Missing items to incorporate (include each item only if it appears in the excerpts):
{{missing_items}}
