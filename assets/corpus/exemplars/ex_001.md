The housing encloses the core assembly and should be machined from 6061-T6 aluminum with a clear anodized finish.
Include venting slots for thermal relief and maintain tolerance of ±0.05 mm on the mounting interface.
Surface roughness on sealing faces should not exceed Ra 1.6 µm and fillet all interior corners at 1.5 mm radius to
reduce stress concentrations.
