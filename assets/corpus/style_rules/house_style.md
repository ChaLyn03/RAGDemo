# House style rules (MVP)

- Tone: concise, engineering-neutral, fabrication/assembly audience.
- Units: prefer mm; if the source does not specify, do not invent values.
- Structure: exactly 3 sections (Overview, Materials & tolerances, Vibration reliability practices).
- Claims: do not add features, dimensions, materials, or tolerances not present in the request/context/IR.
- Wording for unknowns: “Not specified” or “Not specified in provided input”.
