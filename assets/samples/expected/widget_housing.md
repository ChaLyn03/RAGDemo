# Part description: Widget housing

## Overview
Widget housing

We need a short description for a widget housing intended for vibration-prone environments. Emphasize material choice,
basic tolerances, and any mounting or sealing considerations that keep the assembly reliable.

## Recommended approach
- Machine the housing from 6061-T6 aluminum with a clear anodized finish to limit corrosion.
- Hold ±0.05 mm on the mounting interface and keep sealing faces to Ra 1.6 µm.
- Venting slots relieve heat while M5 fasteners with blue threadlocker resist loosening under vibration.
